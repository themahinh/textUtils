# textUtils
A tool for analyzing text data in django backend
Lots of you might say that this could be done easily using JavaScript. But I took this approach to hide my backend code while practicing Django Framework.
Hope you guys liked it!
I have used Bootstrap for making the frontend look good.
Feel free to add any changes
Thanks for reading!!
